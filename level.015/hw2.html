<p>Khinkali are large, savory Georgian soup dumplings traditionally filled with seasoned meat (like a beef, pork, or lamb mix) and spices, served hot, and eaten by hand. They are considered a national dish and are a significant part of Georgian culture, with the juicy broth inside being the most prized part. Eating them requires a specific method: hold the top knot, take a small bite to slurp the broth, and then eat the rest, leaving the knot behind</p>
